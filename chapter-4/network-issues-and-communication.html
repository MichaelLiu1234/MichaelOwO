                <h2 id="#1">Network security</h2>
                <p>Many aspects of security (such as hacking, phishing, pharming and viruses) are covered in depth in Chapter 8. This section covers some of the more general aspects of internet security. </p>
                <p>When accessing the internet, users have to be very careful of many issues — not all of them obvious. Let us first consider the material found on the internet</p>
                <h3>Should the internet be policed? </h3>
                <p>This question has raged for many years. The internet doesn't presently have any controlling body that ensures that it conforms to certain standards. There are many arguments in favour of having control, and as many arguments against it. </p>
                <p>Arguments in favour of some form of control: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>it would help to prevent illegal material being posted on websites (for example, racist/prejudiced and pornographic material, terrorist activities, and so on) </li>
                    <li>people find it much easier to discover information that can have serious consequences (for example, how to be a hacker, how to make bombs, and so on); although most of this information can be found in books, it is much easier to find it using a <strong>search engine </strong></li>
                    <li>it would help to prevent children and other vulnerable groups from being subjected to undesirable websites </li>
                    <li>it would help to stop incorrect information being published on websites. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Arguments against some form of control: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>material published on websites is already available from other sources </li>
                    <li>it would be very expensive to 'police' all websites and users would have to pick up the bill </li>
                    <li>it would be difficult to enforce rules and regulations on a global scale </li>
                    <li>it can be argued that policing would go against freedom of information </li>
                    <li>laws already exist to deal with those who post illegal material/comments on websites. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>One moral issue is the <strong>social divide</strong> created by computer technology and ICT. This is often referred to as the <strong>digital divide</strong>: those people who have the necessary IT skills and/or money to purchase and use computer equipment will benefit from the new technology; those who are not able to access this new technology, either through lack of money, skills or simply because they don't live in a country with the necessary infrastructure, are left even further behind, leading to this digital divide. </p>
                <h3>Inappropriate sites and the accuracy of information</h3>
                <p>The social and general impacts of using the internet or devices that rely on microprocessors have been discussed in earlier sections. It is now worth spending some time looking at the quality of information found on the internet when using a <strong>search engine</strong>. There are three main aspects to consider: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>reliability of information</li>
                    <li>undesirability of certain websites</li>
                    <li>security issues.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Reliability of information</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information on the internet is more likely to be up to date than in books (websites can be updated very quickly). </li>
                    <li>It is much easier to get information from websites (search engines quickly link key words together and find information that matches the criteria). </li>
                    <li>There is a vast amount of information on the internet that is easier to locate than using the indices in several books. </li>
                    <li>Information could also be incorrect, inaccurate or even biased, since it doesn't go through any checking process. </li>
                    <li>There is a real risk of information overload, even if the search engines are used properly; it is possible to get millions of <strong>hits</strong>, which may make it difficult to find the relevant information. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Undesirability of certain websites </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is always a risk of finding undesirable websites. </li>
                    <li>There is also a risk of connecting to websites that are not genuine, which could lead to a number of problems (such as undesirable web links, security risks, and so on). </li>
                    <li>Security risks (these are a real problem — this topic is covered in Chapter 10 and elsewhere throughout the book). </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Security issues </h4>
                <p>Passwords are used in many instances when accessing the internet, for example when: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>accessing your email account </li>
                    <li>carrying out online banking </li>
                    <li>accessing social networking sites. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are many more instances when you might need to type in a password and, in many cases, a user ID. It is important that passwords are protected; some ways of doing this are described below: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>run anti-spyware software to make sure that your passwords aren't being relayed back to whoever put the spyware on your computer </li>
                    <li>change passwords on a regular basis in case they have come into the possession of another user illegally or accidentally </li>
                    <li>
                        passwords should not be easy to guess or break (for example, don't use your favourite colour, name of a pet or favourite rock group); passwords are defined as either 'strong' (hard to break or guess) or 'weak' (relatively easy to break or guess). Strong passwords should contain: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>at least one capital letter </li>
                            <li>at least one numerical value</li>
                            <li>at least one other keyboard character (such as @, *, &). An example of a strong password would be: Sy12@#TT90kj=0. An example of a weak password would be: GREEN. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="2">Authentication</h2>
                <p>Authentication is used to verify that data comes from a secure and trusted source. It works with encryption to strengthen internet security, for example. </p>
                <p>User IDs and passwords are authentication techniques. Some forms of authentication include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>digital certificates (see Section 8.4.4 for more details) </li>
                    <li>biometrics (see Section 8.4.4 for more details) </li>
                    <li>magnetic stripe cards/id cards/passports. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Magnetic stripe cards were covered in Chapter 2. These cards have a magnetic stripe on one side (made up of tiny magnetic particles on a plastic film). Each particle can act as a north-pole or a south-pole (which corresponds to the two binary values of 0 and 1).</p>
                <p>The stripe is read by swiping it through a card reader (see Chapter 2). Data such as name, ID number, sex and date of birth may be contained on a magnetic stripe when used as a security device to allow entry to a building, for example. </p>
                <p><strong>Contactless cards</strong> can be read from a distance and don't have to be through a card reader. This technology was discussed in Chapter 2. Contactless technology can be used in credit/debit cards, for example, to speed up payments in a shop, but they can also be used as a security device. If the card is in a wallet or a pocket, as the owner of the card walks through a security gate, readers either side of the gate quickly scan the security data stored on the tag/chip embedded in the card. Access will only be allowed if the scanned data matches data in a database. </p>
                <p>Some ID cards also use a <strong>holographic image (hologram)</strong>. These are designed to make forgery of the card more difficult. Holographic images change colour or appear to have a moving object when the image is viewed from different angles. As these are difficult to make it stops somebody, for example, simply photocopying a card and using it illegally. The theory behind holograms was discussed in Section 1.5.6. </p>
                <p>Another form of security is to have a photographic image of the card user printed on the card surface. </p>
                <p>Passports make use of some of the technology described above. Many passports contain an RFID tag/chip, a photograph and a holographic image. </p>

                <h2 id="3">Virus</h2>
                <p>The risks of a computer being infected by a virus are discussed in detail in Chapter 8. This section considers how the risk of viruses can be minimised when using the internet or any situation where data is transferred from computer to computer or other electronic devices — it is important to point out that tablets and mobile phones can also be infected by viruses. Any electronic device with a storage capability can be affected by virus attacks.</p>
                <p>Ways of preventing or minimising the risk of viruses are outlined below. </p>
                <h3>Antivirus software</h3>
                <p>Running antivirus software in the background on a computer will constantly check for virus attacks. Although various types of antivirus software work in different ways, they all have the following common features: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>they check software or files before they are run or loaded on a computer </li>
                    <li>antivirus software compares a possible virus against a database of known viruses </li>
                    <li>they carry out <strong>heuristic checking</strong> - this is the checking of software for types of behaviour that could indicate a possible virus; this is useful if software is infected by a virus not yet on the database </li>
                    <li>any possible files or programs that are infected are put into <strong>quarantine</strong> that: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>allows the virus to be automatically deleted, or </li>
                            <li>allows the user to make the decision about deletion (it is possible that the user knows that the file or program is not infected by a virus — this is known as a <strong>false positive</strong> and is one of the disadvantages of antivirus software) </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>antivirus software needs to be kept up to date since new viruses are constantly being discovered </li>
                    <li>full system checks need to be carried out once a week, for example, since some viruses lie dormant and would only be picked up by this full system scan. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Avoiding viruses when accessing the internet </h3>
                <p>One way to help prevent virus attacks when accessing websites on the internet is to avoid unknown or suspicious-looking websites. If in doubt, don't access the website — look for security indicators such as <strong>https</strong> or the padlock symbol.</p>
                <p>Also look out for odd behaviour in the URL. When accessing a new website, for example from an advert in an email, copy and paste the URL into the address bar at the top of the page rather than just clicking on the link in the email. This can help to avoid links to bogus/fake websites. </p>
                <p>It is also not advisable to open emails (or any attachments) from unknown sources. Essentially, the best form of defence against malicious behaviour when making use of the internet is to apply common sense. Many of these issues be discussed in more depth in Chapter 8. </p>
                <h3>Viruses from hardware devices </h3>
                <p>It is possible to pick up viruses from any device plugged into your computer. Apart from the obvious precaution of scanning the device for viruses, it is still unsafe to plug in a device from an unknown source. Even memory sticks or DVDs from friends or from school could still be infected unless they have also carried out all the necessary precautions.</p>
                <h2 id="4">Data protection acts</h2>
                <div class="float-right">
                    <img src="../images/data-protection-act.PNG" alt="image showing main principles of data protection acts">
                    <p>Main principles of data protection acts</p>
                </div>
                <p>Most countries have some form of <strong>data protection act (DPA)</strong>. These are designed to protect individuals and to prevent incorrect or inaccurate data being stored. </p>
                <p>Essentially DPAs are set up to protect the rights of the individual about whom data is obtained, stored and processed (i.e., collection, use, disclosure, destruction and holding of data). Any such act applies to both computerised and paper records. </p>
                <p>Many data protection acts are based on eight principles, as outlined in the image.</p>
                <p>In many countries, failure to abide by these simple rules can lead to a heavy fine or even imprisonment to anyone who holds data about individuals. </p>
                <p>There are general guidelines about how to stop data being obtained unlawfully: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>don't leave personal information lying around on a desk when not attended </li>
                    <li>lock filing cabinets at the end of the day or when the room is unoccupied </li>
                    <li>do not leave data on a computer monitor if it is unattended; log off from the computer if away from your desk for any length of time </li>
                    <li>use passwords and user ids, which should be kept secure; passwords should be difficult to guess/break and should be changed frequently (see earlier notes on passwords) </li>
                    <li>make sure that anything sent in an email or fax (including attachments) is not of a sensitive nature. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of the above are in addition to other security safeguards discussed elsewhere in this book. </p>
                <h2 id="5">Network communication</h2>
                <h3>Faxes and emails</h3>
                <p>There are two basic ways of sending a fax (abbreviation for facsimile — a copy): </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a physical fax (a dedicated machine connected to a telephone line; it requires the number of the recipient to be dialled before the document is copied and then sent electronically) </li>
                    <li>electronic faxing (this requires a network, such as the internet, for the fax to be sent). </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Physical fax machines</h4>
                <div class="float-right"><img src="../images/fax.PNG" alt="image of an fax machine"></div>
                <p><strong>Fax machines</strong> have been used for many years to send and receive paper documents. </p>
                <p>A standard fax machine allows documents to be sent to another fax machine using a normal telephone line. The user places the document in the fax machine tray, lifts the receiver and dials the fax number of the recipient and then presses &lt;send&gt;. At the receiving end, the document is printed on another fax machine. It can be quite a slow way to send a document if the fax line is busy or if there are several pages to send.</p>
                <p>However, a more modern way is <strong>electronic faxing</strong> (or online faxing) which makes use of computer technology and the internet. Electronic faxing has the following advantages over the more traditional method described above: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>costs are reduced as there is no need to buy a fax machine, ink/ toner or paper </li>
                    <li>transfers using electronic methods are encrypted, improving security </li>
                    <li>transmissions are sent to an email account, which is password protected </li>
                    <li>there is no issue of a 'busy signal' preventing the fax being sent. </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="float-right">
                    <img src="../images/sending-fax.PNG" alt="image showing sending an electronic fax">
                    <p>Sending an electronic fax</p>
                </div>
                <p>At this point you may be wondering what is the difference between an electronic fax and an email? The simple answer is not a lot. The only real difference is that online faxing is always associated with an email address and a fax number. The fax number is similar to the traditional fax number and needs to be known by the sender. Having this number allows a user to send fax messages to the recipient. Once a fax is received, the online fax service provider sends an email with the fax message attached in a tiff or pdf format. The sender of the fax can either use an email account or log into any online account to send the fax. </p>
                <p>It is important to realise that it is possible to send a fax from your computer to another device connected to the internet or to a traditional fax machine, where the document will be printed out in the normal way. </p>
                <h4>Emails</h4>
                <div class="float-right"><img src="../images/email.PNG" alt="image showing sending an email"></div>
                <p><strong>Electronic mail (email)</strong> is discussed in many parts of this book. Emails are particularly useful when sending attachments (for example, documents, videos, music, and so on). Emails can be sent to, or sent from, any device connected to the internet. Mail sending attachments it is usually important to have a good, stable internet connection — particularly when sending or receiving large files. The basic difference between emails and electronic faxes was described above; all the advantages and disadvantages of emails apply to electronic faxing when it is sent from computer to computer. </p>
                <p>Emails require an account with an ISP. When sending an email, it is necessary to include the email address (which must be exact), a subject line and any attachments if required.</p>
                <p>The recipient simply has to log on to their account and read the emails in their inbox. </p>
                <p>It is now worth comparing emails with traditional, physical faxes (as indicated above, there are few differences between electronic faxes and emails so they won't be part of this comparison).</p>

                <h3>Video conferencing</h3>
                <div class="float-right"><img src="../images/video-conferencing.PNG" alt="image showing video conferencing"></div>
                <p><strong>Video conferencing</strong> is a communication method that uses both video and sound. It is a substitute for face-to-face conferences between a number of people, who may be in a different part of the country or live overseas. It is carried out in real time and makes use of some form of network. The basic hardware includes: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>webcams</li>
                    <li>large monitors/television screens </li>
                    <li>microphones</li>
                    <li>speakers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are a few items to consider when a conference is about to begin: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>it is essential to agree a time and date for the conference to take place </li>
                    <li>the delegates in each conference room must log in to the video conference system </li>
                    <li>the video conference set-up needs to be checked before the meeting goes live </li>
                    <li>webcams need to be placed in the correct position so that all the delegates in the room are within visual contact (the webcams will capture the images and then transmit them to the other delegates — they will see the images on their own large screens) </li>
                    <li>microphones need to be placed centrally so that all of the delegates can speak — the sound is picked up by the microphones and transmitted to the other delegates (they hear the voices through speakers in their own conference room) </li>
                    <li>it is important for one person to be the main contact in each conference room to make sure that each delegate is able to be heard; this is particularly important if more than two video conference rooms are linked up at the same time. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition to the hardware items described above, it is important to realise that software plays an important role in a successful video conference. </p>

                <h4>Potential issues with video conferencing </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potential time lag in responses/delays when talking. </li>
                    <li>Jerking images usually due to poor internet/network performance or a poor bandwidth. </li>
                    <li>Can be very expensive to set up in the first place (both the hardware and the softy,tare are expensive to purchase and set up correctly). </li>
                    <li>There can be problems if the delegates live in different countries where the time zone differences are large. </li>
                    <li>Training people to use the system correctly can be both costly and time consuming. </li>
                    <li>It can be demotivating for staff if they believe that one of the 'perks' of their job is international travel. </li>
                    <li>The whole system relies on a good network connection — if it breaks down or the signal strength is diminished in any way, then the video conference can be almost unusable. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>As people are in their own building, it is much easier to access important documents or bring in 'experts' at key parts of the conference — this would be difficult if they were a long way away from their office. </li>
                    <li>It is possible to hold conferences at short notice (a conference date can be set up within a few hours as no person needs to travel far). </li>
                    <li>
                        Not travelling physically to meetings reduces costs: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>reduced travelling costs </li>
                            <li>no need to pay for hotel accommodation or venue hire </li>
                            <li>it also reduces the cost of taking people away from their work for two or three days to travel — people are still paid their wage even though they are not in the office, so this is a large 'hidden' cost. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>It may be better to use video conferencing than have delegates travel to potentially unsafe places around the world. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Audio conferencing</h3>
                <p><strong>Audio conferencing</strong> refers to meetings held between people using audio (sound) equipment. The equipment used can be the telephone, a computer (with built-in microphones and speakers) or an internet phone. </p>
                <p>Audio conferencing can be done over the telephone network (often referred to as a <strong>phone conference</strong>). The procedure to be carried out when doing a phone conference is detailed below. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The organiser of the phone conference is given two PINs by the phone company. One PIN is the personal PIN (e.g. 2151) given to the organiser and the second PIN is the participants' PIN (e.g. 8422). </li>
                    <li>The organiser contacts all of the participants and informs them of their PIN and the data and time of the phone conference. </li>
                    <li>When the phone conference is about to start, the organiser dials the conference phone number and, once he/she is connected, keys in his/her personal PIN (2151 in this case). </li>
                    <li>The participants then call the same conference number to join in — once they get through they each input the PIN given to them by the organiser (8422 in this case). Without this PIN, it will be impossible to join the phone conference. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is possible to hold an audio conference using a computer provided a microphone and speakers are connected. This makes use of <strong>Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)</strong>. It is also possible to hook up an internet telephone, which usually plugs into the router or other internet device. </p>
                <p>Using VoIP allows an organiser to create a group of people to take part in the conference call. The group is created by dragging and dropping user names and telephone numbers into the group. When the conference is to take place, the organiser clicks on the required group and the conference is initiated. Using VoIP allows communication using voice, instant messaging and video (by using an attached webcam). If some of the users don't have an internet connection or don't have access to a computer, it is possible to add actual telephone numbers (landline or mobile) to the group. The only real drawback is the quality of the sound when using this technique since it is totally reliant on a fast, stable broadband connection otherwise 'drop out' (loss of voice on occasions), echoing (when the user can hear their own voice being echoed back as they speak) or a very noisy line making it difficult to understand. </p>
                <h3>Web conferencing</h3>
                <p><strong>Web conferencing</strong> (often referred to as a <strong>webinar</strong>) uses the internet to permit conferencing to take place. Multiple computers are used with this system, all connected over the internet. As with video conferencing, it is carried out in real time and allows the following types of meeting to take place: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>business meetings to discuss new ideas </li>
                    <li>presentations </li>
                    <li>online education or training</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The only requirement is a computer and a high-speed, stable internet connection. To carry out web conferencing, each user either downloads an application or logs on to a website from a link supplied in an email from the conference organiser. </p>
                <p>Delegates can leave or join the conference as they wish. The organiser can decide on who can speak at any time using the control panel on their computer. If a delegate wishes to speak, they raise a flag next to their name. Delegates can post comments using instant messaging for all delegates to see at any time. </p>
                <p>Some of the main features include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>slide presentations using presentation software that can be posted on the conference website in advance of the meeting </li>
                    <li>it is possible for any delegate to draw or write on a 'whiteboard' using their own keyboard or mouse </li>
                    <li>it is possible to transmit images or videos using the webcam throughout the conference </li>
                    <li>documents can be shared by uploading them to the website before the conference begins </li>
                    <li>as described earlier, it is possible to chat verbally or by using instant messaging throughout the conference. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>As indicated earlier, web conferencing clearly links into video conferencing and audio conferencing through the use of webcams and built-in microphone and speakers. Essentially it is possible to have a conference using any device that allows these functions (for example, tablets and smartphones would both permit this type of group communication). </p>
