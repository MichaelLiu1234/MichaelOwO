                <p>This chapter covers many forms of <strong>secondary storage</strong> and compares the advantages and
                     disadvantages of each  type. In Chapter 1 you learnt about the primary memory, 
                     known as RAM and ROM. We will consider a number of storage devices later but first 
                     it is important to consider why we need to back up data using these devices and 
                     also how data is accessed.</p>
                <h2 id="1">What is backing up of data?</h2>
                <p><strong>Backing up</strong> refers to the copying of files/data to a different medium (disk, tape, 
                    flash drive, etc.) in case of a problem with the main secondary storage device. 
                    Backing up files and data on a regular basis is seen as good computing practice and 
                    many computer systems can be set to back up files automatically on a regular basis. 
                    An example would be the use of magnetic tapes to back up internet servers on a 
                    regular basis, or cloud storage companies using magnetic tape or hard disk drives to
                    back up clients' data on a regular basis.<br>The backups are often stored in a 
                    different place to the main storage. This is in case of fire or some other situation 
                    that could lead to irretrievable loss of key data/files.</p>
                <h2 id="2">Why back up data?</h2>
                <p>There are various reasons why backups are made. Some of the more common reasons are 
                    considered below.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To safeguard against loss of data due to the failure of the original secondary
                         storage device; this could be due to hardware failure (e.g. head crash on a 
                         hard drive unit), problems caused by files being overwritten accidentally 
                         (or otherwise) or possible corruption of files (for example, caused by power
                          surges)</li>
                    <li>To safeguard against damage caused by hackers. This may not be their intention 
                        (they may only want to gain access to the information for 
                        other purposes, for example to find personal information such as bank account 
                        details). However, the very act of hacking in to files could cause problems such 
                        as corruption or data loss.</li>
                    <li>Backups are also made in case the files need to be used elsewhere; this protects
                         the originals against possible corruption or loss.</li>
                    <li>Backups don't necessarily guard against the effect of a virus. The virus could 
                        attach itself to the files, which could mean that the backups are also affected.
                         If the computer was 'cleaned' of the virus and then the backup files reloaded, 
                         there is a real risk that the virus could infect the computer system again. The 
                         best protection is not to get a virus in the first place.
                    </li>
